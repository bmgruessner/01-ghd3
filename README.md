Design accomplishments:
The basic idea is that I drew a childlike picture of a house on a cloudy day.  When the user runs their cursor over the sun, it becomes a sunny day.  These two frames are shown in Figures 1 and 2 below. The design of my assignment was meant to copy the style of a small child drawing a picture of their house, representing my level of expertise in computer programming.  It also was a style that showcased straightforward simple shapes and colors, fulfilling the basic needs of the assignment. 

Technical aspects:
While Iâ€™m still at the point where I find it very exciting that I could draw a picture like this using html/css/Javascript/D3, interactive elements are going to be a critical part of this class, and I wanted to learn the fundamentals of interaction sooner rather than later.  As such, I sprung to have an interactive sun in my picture.  Upon a mouseover of the sun, the function sunny is called, which removes the cloud by reducing its height to zero and adds in some sunbeams.  It also edits the text in the body.
The shapes were held in a container.  While this decision was based at least partly on that the code I used to figure out my own project used a container, this aspect also made sense for this project and prevented run-ins between the text and picture elements.
